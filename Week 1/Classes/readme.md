In python we have self

The purpose of self is to refer to the instance of the class that the method is being called on. It doesn't represent a constructor; it's just a way for the instance to refer to itself within its own methods.


In simple :- self is used to initialize and access instance variables within the class methods.

and also the word instance and object can be used interchangibly

to access a particular property for an object we have to create a specific function

a class will have attributes and functions

new creates new instances of objects based on a constructor function or class.

this refers to the current instance of an object being created or manipulated, allowing 
access to instance variables and methods.

this helps you access and work with the data (properties) and behavior (methods) of the current object

static functions aren't associated to an object they are associated to the class itself


functions can be called on the object of the class 
cannot be called directly on the class

If we want to call something directly on the class we call the static method
