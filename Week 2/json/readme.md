JSON is used to represent structured data in a text format. It's commonly used to transmit data between a server and a web application as well as to store and exchange data.

Objects: JSON allows you to define objects with key-value pairs (like dictionaries or hash tables in other languages).

Arrays: It supports arrays, which are ordered lists of values.

Simple Values: JSON supports strings, numbers, booleans, null, and can nest objects and arrays within each other.


JSON provides a standardized way to structure and exchange data between different systems and applications, making it a fundamental tool in modern web development and beyond.

while JavaScript objects are convenient for storing and manipulating data within a program, for transmission over networks, we convert these objects into JSON strings (JSON.stringify()) to ensure efficient and standardized data exchange.
