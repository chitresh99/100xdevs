// Array destructuring is a feature in JavaScript that allows you to unpack values from arrays or properties 
// from objects into distinct variables. 
// It provides a concise way to extract multiple elements from an array or properties from an object in a single statement.

const numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];

const [a,b] = numbers;
